# Crab-Graphs


A crab is an undirected graph which has two kinds of vertices: 1 head, and K feet , and exactly K edges which join the head to each of the feet.( 1 <= K <= T, where T is given)

Given an undirected graph, you have to find in it some vertex-disjoint subgraphs where each one is a crab . The goal is to select those crabs in such a way that the total number of vertices covered by them is maximized.

Note: two graphs are vertex-disjoint if they do not have any vertices in common.
